        <p>I'm a senior at Brown studying Computer Science-Economics. My background is primarily in
          backend engineering work, so CS1300 has been my first foray into the world of design. This portfolio 
          will take you chronologicallly through my experience in the class and share some of the cool 
          work and valuable lessons I've learned along the way.

      <hr>
      <div class="section-body mb-2">

        <p> My task was straightforward. I chose a physical interface and conducted user experiments
          with a diverse group of people. Then, I asked them a series of non-leading questions to dig deeper
          into their experience and feelings about using the interface. Finally, I created two personas based
          on this information and crafted a storyboard for one of the fictional personas. 
        </p>
        
        <p> I chose to model this project around an unusually built pasta strainer. This product
          intrigued me because I believed that novices in the kitchen would be ill-equiped to successfully
          use it. It is quite different from the strainers that most people typically use.

      <h4 class="pt-3">The Takeaways</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="section-body mb-4">
        <p> My intuition was correct. Users without too much experience in the kitchen had a very
          difficult time straining pasta with this strainer. They even reported feeling 
          "concerned, anxious, and uncomfortable" in their interactions with the strainer.

        <p>
          Their failure taught me a valuable lesson about design. Interfaces that depart severely
          from the expectations and intuition of potential users must provide ample instruction
          for how to use it. Otherwise, unsavvy users will be lost and abandon the interface. Simple 
          interface avoid this problem all together.
        </p>

        <p>More fundamentally, this project taught me a lot about the design process. Prior to this project, 
          I had no clue what personas were nor had I ever storyboarded before. These tasks
          served as the perfect introduction to the world of design and helped me to build a base of fundamental UI/UX skills.

      <h2 class="pt-5">RESPONSIVE REDESIGN</h2>
      <h4 class="pt-3">The Task</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="section-body mb-2">

        <p> With this project, I ventured into the pits of the internet to find a website that,
          simply put, could use a makeover. 
        </p>
        
        <p> Once I found my site, home to <a href="https://www.castleawards.com/"> Castle Awards </a> of
          East Providence, I thoroughly inspected it for usability and accessibility issues. These issues formed
          the basis for my final product, a new, responsive website for Castle Awards.
        </p>

        <p>
          The key problems that I identified
          were that the page feels incredibly cluttered, does not contain a clear heirarchy, and finding information
          is challenging. Additonally, the site is not responsive to different screen sizes and most of the text on
          the page is actually embedded within images.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="d-flex flex-row align-items-center justify-content-center">

        <p><small>A screenshot of the web landing view of Castle Awards' original site</small></p>
      </div>


      <div class="section-body mb-2">
        <p>
          My first step towards building the new site was to put together a set of low fidelity 
          wireframes that sketched out the basic design of the site across mobile, tablet and web. Then,
          I turned the low-fi wireframes into a series of high fidelity prototypes. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Taking what I had learned from the previous project, I tried to put forward a clean and elegant
          design. For example, I transformed the list of links under the header image to distinct product categories
          with associated images. Additionally, I cleaned up the featured product and landing page views and made them
          much more inviting and friendlier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also made sure to annotate the wireframes and prototypes extensively and construct a visual
          style guide. I took these steps to document my thought processes and provide a set of basic
          instructions for how I planned to build the site.
        </p>

        <p>
          All that's left is to build the site!

      <div class="section-body mb-4">
        <p> 
          For me, the site redesign was a prime lesson in "less is more." The original Castle Awards
          site was flawed in a multitude of ways, but perhaps no more so than its clutter and general
          disorganization. To fix this, I stripped away all of the superflous information and only
          kept the parts of the site that are truly important. Once again, simplicity won the day.
        </p>

        <p> 
          The project also taught me tangible skills that will serve me well throughout my design 
          career. I can envision many scenarios in which low-fi and hi-fi prototyping may come in handy,
          so I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to explore those disciplines here.

      <h2 class="pt-5">ITERATIVE DESIGN</h2>
      <h4 class="pt-3">The Task</h2>
      <hr>
      <div class="section-body mb-2">

        <p> 
          Throughout class we have learned how the iterative design process can lead to better idea 
          generation and variety in designs. Using our newfound experience in lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, 
          my team and I were able to complete the iterative design process to design the interface for 
          an emerging startup. We chose Fancy, a snack-delivery service similar to Uber Eats, featured in YCombinator's 
          demo day.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
          We began the design process by sketching possible designs for the site, trying to expand our own 
          imaginations and not be limited by how food delivery platforms traditionally look. After completing
          four cohesive sets of designs, we evaluated what we thought did and did not make sense to include in the
          final version. This was a particulary interesting task because this process forced us to grapple with
          fundamental questions about the user flow and relative importance of various components of the site.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, we cobbled together sketches from different sets of designs and product a low-fi prototype
          based on the designs. 
        </p>

      <div class="section-body mb-2">
        <p>
          After completing the low-fi prototype, we built a hi-fi prototype. Before finalizing the 
          hi-fi prototype, we received feedback from our peers. This was an helpful checkpoint and
          made us aware of some design flaws that we hadn't considered. After incorporating the feedback
          we finalized our hi-fi prototype.

      <div class="section-body mb-2">
        <p>
          The final step of the iterative design process was collecting user feedback. We created a 
          set of tasks for users to complete and wrote questions that asked about users' experience
          with the prototype and the tasks. We utilized <a href="https://www.usertesting.com">usertesting.com</a> to 
          recruit test subjects. Watching users navigate our prototype was incredibly interesting and 
          showed us where additional refinement needed to be done.

      <div class="section-body mb-4">
        <p>
          Watching our thoughts transform from sketches, to low-fi, and then to hi-fi prototypes that 
          were being used by real people was incredible to watch. I loved seeing the ideas grow and change
          as more thought was given to both big ideas like user flow and small details like button placement.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For me, this project also emphasized the critical role that feedback and demonstration play
          in design. Without the peer hi-fi review, our final prototype would have functioned far worse.
          Additionally, if we were to deploy a website based on the prototype, the user testing feedback 
          absolutely must be incorporated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The user testing feedback also drove home the idea that designers must always place their users
          first. We must be aware of how people think and how people will approach the application. These 
          considerations cannot come second to aesthetics or ease of developement.

      <div class="section-body mb-2">

        <p> 
          This project was focused on using React, a framework often used to build dynamic, interactive
          websites. We were tasked with building a site that contained filtering, sorting, and aggregating
          functionalities, so I decided to build a virtual grocery store. 
        </p>

        <p>
          In thinking about how the site should be designed, I knew that I wanted the sorting and filtering
          options to be clear and intuitive to use. Similarly, I wanted it to be clear when items were added
          to the aggregator. I felt strongly that I must obey these principles because these were some of the 
          flaws with our iterative design prototype for Fancy.

          This project felt particularly rewarding to work on because I felt like I could apply many of the 
          lessons that I had learned from previous projects. For example, I focused on constructing a simple and intuitive design.
          I put the users' needs first and tried to imitate the experience of seeing food at the grocery store to 
          meet customer expectations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also really enjoyed my hands-on experience with React. I learned how to think about a state-model, how to
          organize an application heirarchy, how to write callback functions, and got into the nitty-gritty of front
          end development. It truly was the culmination of a semesters worth of learning and personal growth.
